            Jermaine Lamar Cole (born January 28, 1985), known professionally as
            J. Cole, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter and record
            producer. Born on a military base in Germany but raised in
            Fayetteville, North Carolina, Cole initially gained recognition as a
            rapper following the release of his debut mixtape, The Come Up, in
            early 2007. Intent on further pursuing a solo career as a rapper, he
            went on to release two additional mixtapes, The Warm Up and Friday
            Night Lights after signing to Jay-Z's Roc Nation imprint in 2009.

            Cole released his debut studio album, Cole World: The Sideline
            Story, in 2011. It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200,
            and was soon certified platinum by the Recording Industry
            Association of America (RIAA). His next two releases, 2013's Born
            Sinner and 2014's 2014 Forest Hills Drive, received mostly positive
            reviews from critics, and both were certified platinum in the United
            States. The latter earned him his first Grammy Award nomination for
            Best Rap Album. In December 2016, Cole released his fourth studio
            album 4 Your Eyez Only. The album debuted at number one on the
            Billboard 200 chart and was certified platinum in April 2017. His
            fifth album, KOD, was released in April 2018. The album debuted atop
            the Billboard 200, making it his fifth album to reach number one on
            the chart.

            Self-taught on piano, Cole also acts as a producer alongside his
            hip-hop career, producing singles for artists such as Kendrick Lamar
            and Janet Jackson, as well as handling the majority of the
            production in his own projects. He has also developed other
            ventures, including Dreamville Records, as well as a non-profit
            organization called the Dreamville Foundation. In January 2015, Cole
            decided to house single mothers rent-free at his childhood home in
            Fayetteville, North Carolina.
